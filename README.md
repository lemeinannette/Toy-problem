Week 1 Toy Problems

In this week's challenges, you will be working on three JavaScript toy problems. These problems are designed to help you practice your JavaScript skills and problem-solving abilities.

Instructions
1.Create a GitHub Repository
2.Use Javascript
3.Push to GitHub
4.Submit the Repository Link



Challenges
Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond to the correct grade, as shown below:

A > 79
B - 60 to 79
C - 59 to 49
D - 40 to 49
E - less than 40

Challenge 2: Speed Detector 
Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input, e.g., 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok." Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: "Points: 2."
If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: "License suspended."

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator 
Write a program that calculates an individual's Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e., Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

Please use the KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the links in your canvas page.

Resources
To perform these calculations, we will use the following resources:

Tax Rates ([https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.htm](https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.htm)): This link provides the tax rates we will use to calculate the payee (Tax).
KRA PAYE [KRA Pay As You Earn (PAYE)](https://www.kra.go.ke/individual/calculate-tax/calculating-tax/paye): Additional information and guidelines on calculating PAYE.
